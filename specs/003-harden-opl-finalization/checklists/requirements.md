# Specification Quality Checklist: Finalização OPL confiável e resiliente

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-08-06
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation completed in one pass on 2026-08-06.
- The gap analysis names existing product behavior and the OPL-facing file conventions needed to define the problem; it does not prescribe source modules, frameworks, protocols, or code structure.
- The specification is ready for `$speckit-plan`; `$speckit-clarify` remains optional because no critical ambiguity is open.
